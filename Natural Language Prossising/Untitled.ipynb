      "\n",
      "The ledger was full of most precise information : date of laying , length of incubation period , number of chick reaching the first week , second week , fifth week , weight of hen , size of rooster's wattles and so on , all scrawled out in a hand that looked more Chinese than English , the most jagged and sprawling Alex had ever seen .\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But after the doctor's return that night Alex could see , from the high window in his own room , the now familiar figure crouched on a truly impressive heap of towels , apparently giving its egg-hatching powers one final chance before it was replaced in its office by a sure-enough hen .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A knocking at Alex's door roused him at six o'clock the following morning .\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The market was not far and , once there , the doctor's sense of immediacy left him and he fell into a state of harmony with the birds around him .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He stroked the hens and they responded with delighted clucks , he gobbled with the turkeys and they at once were all attention , he quacked with the ducks , and cackled with a pair of exceedingly flattered geese .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The dawn progressed and it seemed that the doctor would never be done with his ministrations when quite abruptly something broke his revery .\n",

      "\n",
      "The doctor , with the air of a man whose professional interests have found scope , drew Alex's attention to those excellences which might otherwise have escaped him : the fine color in comb and wattles , the length and quality of neck and saddle hackles , the firm , wide spread of the toes , and a rare justness in the formation of the ear lappets .\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Alex entered first and was followed by the doctor who , for all his care , manifested a perceptible bulge on his left side where the hen was cradled .\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctor , he noticed , was attempting a transverse movement towards the stairs , but before the movement could be completed a distinct and audible cluck ruffled the air in the hollow of the stair-well .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Eyes swerved in the patronne's head , Alex coughed loudly , and the doctor , with a sforzando of chicken noises floating behind him , took to the stairs in long-shanked leaps .\n",

      "There was no reference to the incident on the stairs , his powers being absorbed by this more immediate business .\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One part of her audience was totally engaged , the connoisseur witnessing a peculiarly fine performance of some ancient classic , the other part , the guest of the connoisseur , attentive as one who must take an intelligent interest in that which he does not fully understand .\n",
